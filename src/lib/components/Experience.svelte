					Designed and developed hardware (PCB layout & design) and software (embedded RTOS &
					full-stack web applications) for high-fidelity connected device prototypes across Fire
					Service, Gas Detection, Fall Protection, and Business Systems products across all stages
					of product lifecycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Led diverse teams of engineers and designers to deliver feature-rich, dynamic systems for
					the purposes of collecting and analyzing product usability and performance for new product
					concepts. Created field simulation techniques to create hands-on experiences for end users
					according to product visions, the results of which generated hundreds of actionable
					insights for engineers and designers to refine their products.
